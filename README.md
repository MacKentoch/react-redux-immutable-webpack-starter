#### full ES6-ES2015

> My best React + redux project starter.

- *webpack is as simple as possible*
- *ReactJS + Redux + React Router all immutable (all component extend PureComponent).*
- *`pure front-end` = server independant (use whatever you want as server: NodeJS, Rails, .NET...)*

*Concept behind:* same as [react-bootstrap-webpack-starter](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-bootstrap-webpack-starter) **but added `Redux` and amazing and helpful `redux-devtools`.**

## Breaking changes since v0.5.0
ReactJS v15.4.x required react-hot-loader to be v3+ (*previous react-hot-loader was v1.x and v1.3.1 came too late*). So This starter had to include breaking changes to follow all of that.

## Detailed Content

**Front:**
- React JS (15.x - [github :link:](https://github.com/facebook/react))
- Redux (*as you application grows managing state will be a serious concern, save pain with Redux*)
- React-Redux (*Redux is not specific to ReactJS, you could easily use it with Angular2 for instance*)
- Immutable JS
- Redux-devtools (*want to time travel your application State?*)
- React-Router-Redux (*previously named react-simple-router*)
- react-router (2.x- [github :link:](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router))
- Bootstrap (3.x - [github :link:](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap))
- React-Bootstrap ([github :link:](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap))
- font-awesome ([github :link:](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome))
- animate.css ([github :link:](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css))
- classnames ([github :link:](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames))
- react-motion ([github :link:](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion))
- Webpack ([github :link:](https://github.com/webpack/webpack))
- babel 6+ ([github :link:](https://github.com/babel/babel))
- react-addons-shallow-compare (*pure render mixin equivalent for ES6*)
- whatwg-fetch (*Why: because it is a fetch `Web API` polyfill*)

**Tool chain:**
- babel 6+
- eslint
- hot reload
- loaders
  - `js` / `jsx`
